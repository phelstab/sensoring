    "E4_Gsr 123345627891.123 3.129\n",
    "Data Streams\n",
    "The available data streams are:\n",
    "\n",
    "E4_Acc - 3-axis acceleration\n",
    "E4_Bvp - Blood Volume Pulse\n",

    "The timestamp for the sample in seconds defined as time interval between the sample received and the reference date, 1 January 1970, GMT. The value contains a fractional part to represent microseconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample timestamps are calculated with reference to the first packet received by the E4 streaming server. Upon reception of the first packet, the system timestamp is recorded and the sample timestamps of the first and any further packets are calculated from the reference timestamp and the sample frequency of the respective stream.\n",

    "Data\n",
    "Each stream type has a different data format as described below:\n",

    "Acceleration Data\n",
    "The acceleration value for x axis. The x axis is defined by the vector whose starting point is set to the center of the device and whose direction points towards the USB slot.\n",
    "The acceleration value for y axis. The y axis is defined by the vector whose starting point is set to the center of the device and whose direction points towards the shorter strap.\n",
    "The acceleration value for z axis. The z axis is defined by the vector whose starting point is set to the center of the device and whose direction points towards the bottom of the device.\n",
